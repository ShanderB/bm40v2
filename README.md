Fist of all, i'm thankfull to [Guilherme BermÃªo](https://github.com/GMBermeo)

'myKeys' is a folder with the build files for pt-br with INTL win keyboard config.

'back' is the bacukp files. All working (somehow)

'hexes' is the builded file. You just need to upload to qmk toolbox.

if want to change someting, change inside myKeys\rev2\keymaps\try
